{% assign product = include.product %}


These terms and conditions apply to the [{{ product }} SDK]({{include.url}}). Read carefully before purchasing a license.

## License Details

A license is valid for **one product**, as specified by the bundle ID you provide at the time of purchase.
Additional bundles can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per bundle ID.


### License Activation

You can start using your license immediately after puchase, using the license key that you receive in your purchase confirmation.


### License Validation

Licenses require server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product will perform regular server validation.


### License Expiration

Your license expires when your subscription ends. This will stop your product from being able to use {{ product }}, both in development and in production.


### License Adjustments

Your purchase information can't be changed after a purchase is completed, but can be overridden by {{ product }} if needed. Please [reach out]({{site.email_url}}) if you need to change any information.


## Free Trial

All subscriptions include a free trial, during which you have unlimited access to all the features in the selected tier. The trial will automatically convert to a paid plan if you don’t cancel it.


## Refunds

You can cancel the free trial at any time. No refunds will be approved after the free trial ends. You can cancel your subscription at any time, to stop it from renewing.


## Technical Information

{{ product }} targets the current OS versions and two major versions back (one for macOS). Support for older OS versions are only removed in major version bumps.

{{ product }} is built with the latest version of Xcode, but offers on-demand builds for the previous major version, up to three months after the latest major version was released. 


## Feature Disclaimer

Features may use technologies that may stop working in any future platform (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, etc.) update, due to changes in the operating system, platform, or any other layers.

Features that stop working due to these kind of changes may be removed without replacement or compensation, since the required capabilities may no longer be available.
