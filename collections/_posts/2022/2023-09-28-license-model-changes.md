The LicenseKit [license model](/licenses) has been updated to be more affordable for single indie developers and smaller startups, while also providing more functionality.

{% include kankoda/data/product.html name="LicenseKit" %}

LicenseKit is now **$99/year** for solo indies with max $100k in annual revenue, and **$1,000/year** for startups with max 5 people and max $500k in annual revenue.

The license model has also been tweaked so that all tiers include all functionality. This means that there are no longer a hard caps on the number of licenses you can manage on the lower tiers.

We hope that indie developers and startups like this change, and look forward to growing together.
