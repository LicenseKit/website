LicenseKit 0.7 is out. This new minor version moves a lot of types into the `License` model and replaces concrete service types with a convenient enum.

Nesting `License`-related types within the license model makes the library a lot smaller and easier to overview.

Replacing the concrete service types with an enum makes it a lot easier to understand what kind of services you can create.

All in all, this version makes the library a lot more approachable.
