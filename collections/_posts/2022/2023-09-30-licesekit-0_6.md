You have always been able to use a remote license service to integrate with REST-based APIs. This support is however extended in 0.5, which now uses a new API configuration model.

This configuration model makes is easy to specify configurations for every external service that you want to integrate with. As a result of this, there is a brand new Gumroad integration layer that lets you start fetching licenses from Gumroad with just a few lines of code.

Many library types have been renamed, removed, consolidated, etc. to provide a much cleaner API that is easier to use. The documentation has been thoroughly rewritten, and has new sample code.
