The LicenseKit SDK license tiers are changing next year. Here's what you need to know, if you are considering signing up for a LicenseKit license.

The LicenseKit [tier model]({{page.tiers}}) has two tiers - Basic and Gold. There is also a [FREE]({{page.tiers}}) license key that you can use to try out LicenseKit with a limited set of licenses. Starting from next year, the [Basic]({{page.tiers}}) tier will be price adjusted to $500, while the [Gold]({{page.tiers}}) tier will stay as is.

Since LicenseKit is still in early beta, you now have the chance to sign up for a forever cheap [Basic]({{page.tiers}}) license. If you sign up for just [$100]({{page.tiers}}) before the end of the year, you will keep that price forever, including the current number of licenses if it changes in the future, or the new number if increases.
