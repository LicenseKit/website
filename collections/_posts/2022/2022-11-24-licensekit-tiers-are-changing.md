The LicenseKit SDK license tiers are changing next year. Here's what you need to know, if you are considering signing up for a LicenseKit license.

The current [tier model]({{page.tiers}}) only contains two tiers - Basic and Gold. There is also a [FREE]({{page.tiers}}) license key that you can use to try out LicenseKit with a limited set of licenses.

Starting from next year, the [Basic]({{page.tiers}}) tier will be price adjusted to $500, while the [Gold]({{page.tiers}}) tier will stay as is. There will also be a new [Silver]({{page.tiers}}) tier that will be priced between Basic and Gold.

Since LicenseKit is still in early beta, you now have the chance to sign up for a forever cheap [Basic]({{page.tiers}}) license. If you sign up for just [$100]({{page.tiers}}) before the end of the year, you will keep that price forever!

To join the forever cheap license program, just buy a [Basic]({{page.tiers}}) license from the [license page]({{page.tiers}}). It will then be tagged as forever cheap, which means that you will just pay $100 every time you renew it.

Forever.
