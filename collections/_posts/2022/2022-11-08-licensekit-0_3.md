LicenseKit 0.3 is out with a bunch of new features, like a new tier, a new proxy service and a free tier that lets you use LicenseKit for free.


## Free license

If you use **"FREE"** as license key when creating a license engine, you will register a free license that is capped to 10 licenses and can be used with local and file-based engines.

```swift
let engine = try LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "FREE") { license in
    // Set up a license service here 
}
```

This makes it possible for you to use LicenseKit for free, for as many apps and libraries as you need, until you need more licenses or want to access more powerful features.


## License service proxy

There's a new `LicenseServiceProxy` that can be used to combine multiple license services, for instance to handle local, file-based and remote licenses with a single service.

```swift
let engine = try LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "your-license-key") { license in
    LicenseServiceProxy(
        services: [
            CsvLicenseService(
                license: license,
                fileName: "licenses",
                fileExtension: "csv"
            )Â { rows in
                rows.map {
                    License(licenseKey: row[0])
                }
            },
            LocalLicenseService(
                license: license,
                licenses: [
                    License(licenseKey: "license-key-1"),
                    License(licenseKey: "license-key-2")
                ]
            )
        ]
    )
}
```

In the code above, we create a proxy that first tries to find a license in a csv file. If this doesn't work, it will then try to find a match in a hard-coded set of licenses. If both fails, it will throw an error.
