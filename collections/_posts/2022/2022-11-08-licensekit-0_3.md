LicenseKit 0.3 is out with a few new features, like a new proxy service and a [free license]({{page.licenses}}) that lets you use LicenseKit for free.


## Free license

If you use **"FREE"** as license key when creating a license engine, you will register a [free license]({{page.licenses}}) that is capped to a small number of local or file-based licenses.

```swift
let engine = try LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "FREE") { license in
    // Set up a license service here 
}
```

This makes it possible to use LicenseKit for free, for as many apps and libraries as you need, until you need more licenses or more powerful features.


## License service proxy

There's a new `LicenseServiceProxy` that can be used to combine multiple license services, for instance to handle local, file-based and remote licenses with a single service.

```swift
let engine = try LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "your-license-key") { license in
    LicenseServiceProxy(
        services: [
            CsvLicenseService(
                license: license,
                fileName: "licenses",
                fileExtension: "csv"
            )Â { rows in
                rows.map {
                    License(licenseKey: row[0])
                }
            },
            LocalLicenseService(
                license: license,
                licenses: [
                    License(licenseKey: "license-key-1"),
                    License(licenseKey: "license-key-2")
                ]
            )
        ]
    )
}
```

In the code above, we create a proxy that first tries to find a license in a csv file. If this doesn't work, it will then try to find a match in a hard-coded set of licenses. If both fails, it will throw an error.
