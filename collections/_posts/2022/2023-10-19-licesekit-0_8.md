LicenseKit 0.8 is out with a bunch of changes to the license engine and services, that make them easier to use. These changes also make it possible for LicenseKit to offer monthly subscriptions.

## License Improvements

A `LicenseEngine` can now be created with a Gumroad license key. This means that you can start using LicenseKit immediately after signing up, without having to wait for the license to be activated.

Yearly licenses will be added to the binary like before, while monthly licenses will not. This means that monthly licenses will always require a server roundtrip to validate. 

Yearly licenses will still be valid in shipped apps after they expire. Monthly licenses will however stop working even in shipped apps when the license expires.


## License Service Improvements

The various `LicenseServiceType` cases no longer need a license. This is now handled by the license engine. This also means that the engine no longer provides your license in the service builder.

The `.api` and `.gumroad` services has new `cached` capabilities, that lets you cache them by just setting a flag to true, instead of having to do the cache wrapping yourself.

The `Gumroad.Purchase` type will now provide you with a default parsed `license`, that maps as much as possible from the raw response. You can return this license right away, or modify it as needed.


## Breaking changes

The `LicenseEngine` initializer is now async to support Gumroad. This means that you will have to adjust your code to support concurrency when creating the license engine.

The license changes in the engine and the services will require you to remove any license handling that you currently have in place. The code will be cleaner as a result.
