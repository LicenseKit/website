## How does software licenses work?

If you plan on distributing a closed-source product, like a software SDK, or an app for iOS or macOS that isn't purchased through the App Store, and want users to pay for using the software, you need to protect it from being used freely.

One way to protect your software is to use a commercial license model, where users have to enter a license key before they can use your software. For this to work, you need to be able to define and validate your licenses. This is where LicenseKit comes in.


## How does LicenseKit work?

LicenseKit lets you define licenses with code or in files, or validate license keys over the cloud, to integrate with any external service provider. It works on all major Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS) and can be used with both SDKs and apps.

LicenseKit licenses can define many different properties, like customer information, tier, activation and expiration date, included features, and much more. You can also use custom fields if needed.
