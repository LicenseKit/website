LicenseKit is free for up to **10** binary or file-based licenses. You can then upgrade to a paid plan once you need more licenses or additional functionality.

Licenses can be purchased from the [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) e-shop. [Reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) if you want to include any add-ons, or if you have other support needs or preferred methods of payment or invoicing.




## Enterprise Licenses

The standard tiers are aimed at indie developers, startups and small businesses. For companies and organizations with more than $1M USD in annual proceeds, [reach out for a custom plan](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License).


## License terms

By purchasing a LicenseKit license, you acknowledge and approve the [license terms & conditions](/terms-and-conditions).
