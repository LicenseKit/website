LicenseKit is free for up to **10** code- or file-based licenses. Just use the license key **"FREE"** to use the free plan. Upgrade to a paid plan once you need more licenses or additional functionality.

Licenses can be purchased from the [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) e-shop. Companies with over $1M in annual proceeds can [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) for a custom plan.
