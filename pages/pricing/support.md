LicenseKit has different support levels, that are based on the license tiers and your specific needs.


## GitHub Issues

All license customers can use [GitHub Issues]({{site.github_url}}/issues) to get help with problems, request features, discuss etc.

This is also where the product roadmap lives, and where versions are planned and assigned issues.


## E-mail support

Medium and Large tier customers can reach out over e-mail to get help with problems, ask questions, schedule paid support, etc.


## Prioritized support

Large tier customers have prioritized support, which means that their needs will be considered and prioritized when planning bug fixes and future releases.


## Dedicated support

Custom license customers can customize the support level to their needs, schedule recurring or one-time support activites, pay for recurring support or dedicated development, etc.
