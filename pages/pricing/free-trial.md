description: LicenseKit has a free trial
---

LicenseKit has a free 7 day trial, that lets you try out LicenseKit before committing to a purchase. The trial gives you unlimited access to all the features in the selected tier.


## License Validation

The free trial requires server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product must perform regular server validations.


## License Expiration

The free trial stops working if you end it. This will affect shipped apps, which will no longer be able to validate licenses once the license expires.
