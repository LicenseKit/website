description: LicenseKit has a free trial
---

LicenseKit has a [7 day free trial]({{site.gumroad_url}}) that gives you unlimited access to all the features in the selected tier.


## License Expiration

The free trial stops working if you cancel it. This will affect shipped apps, which will no longer be able to validate licenses with LicenseKit.


## License Validation

The free trial requires server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product will perform regular server validations to ensure that the license is valid.

If your free trial converts to a yearly license, it will be added to a new LicenseKit version, after which it will validate locally without server roundtrips.
