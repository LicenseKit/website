description: LicenseKit has monthly payment plan
---

LicenseKit has a monthly payment plan that lets you pay as you go, instead of paying for a full year at once. There are however trade-offs with this plan.


## Price

Monthly licenses have a higher total price. Save on your license costs by paying for a full year at once.


## License Expiration

Expiration of a yearly license doesn't affect already shipped products and apps that use it. The license will still validate in production and the product/app will still work.

Expiration of a monthly license *will* affect already shipped products. The license will stop working and the product will no longer be able to validate licenses.



## License Validation

Monthly licenses require server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product will perform regular server validations.

Yearly licenses will be added to the next version of LicenceKit, and can after that be validated without the need for server validation.
