description: LicenseKit has monthly payment plan
---

LicenseKit has a monthly payment plan that lets you pay as you go, instead of paying for a full year at once. There are however trade-offs with this plan, so read this carefully before you proceed.


## Price

Monthly licenses have a higher price than yearly ones. Save on your total license costs by paying for a full year at once.


## License Validation

Monthly licenses require server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product must perform regular server validations.

Yearly licenses are added to LicenceKit and can be validated without the need for a server roundtrip.


## License Expiration

Monthly licenses stop working when the subscription ends. This will affect shipped apps, which will no longer be able to validate licenses once the license expires.

Yearly licenses are always valid for production use in versions in which they are active. Expiration will not affect already shipped apps.
