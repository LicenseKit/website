LicenseKit has many optional add-on services, that are either included in the higher tiers, or available as optional add-ons.


## Onboarding call

Large tier customers have the option to connect over an initial onboarding call, where we'll discuss your needs and help you get started.


## Monthly call

Large tier customers have the option to connect over a monthly call, where we can keep in touch and keep track of your project, discuss any problems or questions that you may have, etc.


## Multi-platform

LicenseKit is by default distributed with support for iOS only. Large tier customers can opt-in to get a build that supports all available platforms.


## Additional bundles

LicenseKit licenses are valid for **one year** and **one product**. You can add additional bundle IDs to your license, at a **50% discount per bundle**.


## Development licenses

You can add additional development licenses to a production license, for an alternate build of your app and keyboard, at a **50% discount per test license**.

A development licence can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production. Development licenses that are used in production, may be terminated at any time.
