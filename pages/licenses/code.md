Code-based licenses are a great alternative to bundle your licenses within your software's source code. The license information is compiled together with the source code.

LicenseKit licenses lets you define customer information and many license properties like tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more. You can also define completely custom fields if you need to.
