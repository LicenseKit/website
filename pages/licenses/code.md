Code-based licenses is a great alternative when you want to bundle licenses with your product. The license information is compiled into the binary and can be validated even when offline.

LicenseKit licenses lets you define customer information and license information like tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more.

Code-based licenses require new versions of your software to add and remove licenses and update the information of already released licenses. 

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions it is active in.
