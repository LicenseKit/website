description: LicenseKit lets you define licenses in plain text files.
---

File-based licenses let you bundle license files from another license system with your product. The licenses are compiled into the binary and can be validated even when offline.

LicenseKit licenses lets you define customer information and license information like tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more.

File-based licenses require new versions of your software to add and remove licenses and update the information of already released licenses. 

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions it is active in.
