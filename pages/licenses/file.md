description: LicenseKit lets you define licenses in plain text files.
---

Plain text files are a great alternative if you want to export data from a license system and bundle them as csv files together with your source code.

LicenseKit will parse the text file and allow you to map each line to a LicenseKit license, with support for customer information, tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more. You can also define completely custom fields if you need to.
