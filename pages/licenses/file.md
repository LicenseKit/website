File-based licenses is a great alternative if you want to bundle many licenses in your product binary. The license file is bundled with the binary and can be validated even when offline.

## How does it work?

File-based licenses let you bundle license files together with your product binary. You can also refer to files at any URL, for instance if you send the license file to your customers.

Files is a great alternative if you want to batch export licenses from another license system and use them in your product. LicenseKit makes it easy to parse huge datasets into a license representation.

If your license files are built into the product binary, you must release new product versions to add, remove and edit licenses.

## License expiration

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions where the license was active.

The model you choose really depends on your business model. Companies like Sketch let you use expired licenses, with hope that new features will make you renew your license.
