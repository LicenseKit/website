Binary licenses is a great alternative when you want to bundle your licenses in your product binary. The license information is compiled into the binary and can be validated even when offline.

## How does it work?

LicenseKit lets you define customer and license information like tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more, directly into the binary license.

Since binary licenses are built into the product binary, you must release new product versions to add, remove and edit licenses.

## License expiration

You can choose if a license should expire on its expiration date, or if you want your customer to be able to keep using it in all versions where the license was active.

The model you choose really depends on your business model. Companies like Sketch let you use expired licenses, with hope that new features will make you renew your license.
