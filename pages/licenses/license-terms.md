# Terms & Conditions

These terms & conditions apply to the LicenseKit SDK (hereby referred to as "the Product").


## License Details

Licenses are valid for **one product**, as specified by the bundle ID you provide at the time of purchase.

Expiration of a yearly license doesn't affect already shipped products and apps that use it. The license will still validate in production and the product/app will still work.

Expiration of a monthly license *will* affect already shipped products. The license will stop working and the product will no longer be able to validate licenses.

Additional bundle IDs can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per ID. This lets you use a license with more products, at a reduced price.


## License Activation

You can start using your license with LicenseKit immediately after puchase, using the license key that you will receive in your purchase confirmation.


## License Validation

Monthly licenses require server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product will perform regular server validations.

Yearly licenses will be added to the next version of LicenceKit, and can after that be validated without the need for server validation.


## License Upgrades

Please reach out if you're considering upgrading your license or want to enable some add-ons. We'll find a tailored upgrade plan that suits you.


## Monthly Plan

LicenseKit has a monthly payment plan that lets you pay as you go, instead of paying for a full year at once. There are however trade-offs with this plan, so [read this](/pricing/monthly-plan) carefully before you proceed.


## Technical Information

The Product targets the current OS version and two major versions back (one for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump.

The Product is built with the latest version of Xcode, but offers on-demand builds for the previous major version up to three months after the latest major version was released. 


## Feature Disclaimer

Some Product features use technologies that may stop working in any future platform (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, etc.) update.

Features that stop working due to such platform changes may be removed without replacement or compensation, since the required platform capabilities may no longer be available.


## Refunds

You can stop a monthly subscription from renewing at any time. Your license will automatically expire after the last subscription date, at which license validation will stop working in your product.

You can stop a yearly subscription from renewing at any time. Your license will automatically expire after the last subscription date. This will not affect already shipped apps.

Limited refunds may be approved after a payment has been processed. The payment processing fees and cost for the used period will be deducted from the refunded amount.

No refunds will be approved for a yearly license after it has been added to the LicenseKit binary, since itwill then always be active in that binary version.


## Closed Source License Agreement

This license agreement applies to the LicenseKit SDK (hereby referred to as "the Software").

The Software and any associated software, documentation and resources  must only be used with a valid license key and a prior written agreement between the licenser and the licensee.

The Software must only be used in application(s) that are included in the license agreement, and must not be distributed to, or used by, developers, teams, companies or other parties that are not covered by the license agreement.

Any attempts to bypass or work around these limitations or any other restrictions or security mechanisms in the Software, will be considered as an attempt to violate the license agreement and may terminate the license and render the licenser liable to compensate the licensee for any efforts, damages, loss of IP or any other economic losses caused by the infringement.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-ABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


## Laws and Regulations

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden.

The courts of Sweden shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these terms.
