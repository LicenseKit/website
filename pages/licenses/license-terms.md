## License Details

Licenses are valid for **one year** and **one app**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using LicenseKit. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Additional bundles and test licenses can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per ID/license. A test license can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production.


## License Activation

After purchasing a license, you will receive a welcome e-mail with your license key once the license has been activated, typically within 48 hours.

If we are unable to activate your license within this time, we will get in touch with you to explain the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before your license has been activated.

The license period starts when the license is activated, not at the time of purchase. This means that the time it takes to activate your license doesn’t affect the license validity period.


## License Upgrades

Please reach out if you're considering upgrading your current license. We'll find a tailored upgrade plan that suits you.


## Technical information

LicenseKit targets the current OS versions and two major versions back (one major version for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump and will be communicated in advance.

LicenseKit is built with the latest version of Xcode, but supports on-demand builds for the last major version up to three months after a new major version is released. After that, you must use the latest major version of Xcode.


## Closed Source License Agreement

This license agreement applies to the LicenseKit SDK (hereby referred to as "the Software").

The Software and any associated software, documentation and resources  must only be used with a valid license key and a prior written agreement between the licenser and the licensee.

The Software must only be used in application(s) that are included in the license agreement, and must not be distributed to, or used by, developers, teams, companies or other parties that are not covered by the license agreement.

Any attempts to bypass or work around these limitations or any other restrictions or security mechanisms in the Software, will be considered as an attempt to violate the license agreement and may terminate the license and render the licenser liable to compensate the licensee for any efforts, damages, loss of IP or any other economic losses caused by the infringement.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-ABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


## Laws and Regulations

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden.

The courts of Sweden shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these terms.
