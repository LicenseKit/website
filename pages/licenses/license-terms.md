## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year** and **one product**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using LicenseKit. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Additional bundle IDs and development licenses can be added at a **50% discount**. A development license can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production.

By signing up for a license, you acknowledge and approve of the following terms and conditions.


## Technical information

LicenseKit targets the current OS versions and two major versions back (one major version for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump and will be communicated in advance.

LicenseKit is built with the latest version of Xcode, but supports on-demand builds for the last major version up to three months after a new major version is released. After that, you must use the latest major version of Xcode.


## Closed Source License Agreement

This software and any associated software, documentation and resources (hereby referred to as "the Software") must only be used with a valid license key and a prior mutual and written agreement between the licenser and the licensee.

The Software must only be used in the application(s) that are included in the license agreement and must not be distributed to or used by developers, teams, companies or other parties that are not covered by the license agreement.

Any attempts to bypass or work around these limitations or any other restrictions or security mechanisms in the Software, will be seen as an attempt to violate the license agreement and may render the licenser liable to compensate the licensee for any damages, loss of IP or any other economic losses caused by the infringement.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-ABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
