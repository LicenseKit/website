Cloud-based licenses is a great alternative when you want to use an external license service, such as Gumroad or LemonSqueezy.

LicenseKit can integrate with any external service provider and lets you map provider-specific data to LicenseKit licenses.

LicenseKit licenses can define customer information and license information like tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more.

If your software needs to work offline, you can configure LicenseKit to cache successful validations and pass validation if a network-based error occurs. You can also define if a successful validation is needed before users can start using your software.
