description: LicenseKit lets you validate licenses over the cloud.
---

Cloud-based validation is a great alternative if you use an external service provider to manage your licenses, such as Gumroad or LemonSqueezy.

LicenseKit can integrate with any external service provider and lets you map provider-specific data to a LicenseKit license, with support for customer information, tier, activation and expiration date, supported platforms, included features, and much more. You can also define completely custom fields if you need to.

If your software needs to work offline, you can configure the license engine to cache any successful validation and let validation pass if a network-based error occurs. You can also define if the license needs an initial successful validation or not before the user can start using the software.
