## Licenses

LicenseKit requires a commercial license to unlock support for more licenses and more powerful features. There is one free and two paid tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

The **Free** tier lets you try out LicenseKit in any app or library. Just use the license key **"FREE"** when you set up LicenseKit, and you will get a free trial version that you can use forever.

The **Basic** tier is perfect for smaller project with few users, while the **Gold** tier is perfect for larger, commercial projects with many users.

Licenses can be purchased directly from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad}}) or with your preferred method of payment (Paypal, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one app/library** and for **one year**. After your license expires, you have to extend your license or purchase a new one to keep using LicenseKit.

LicenseKit supports **iOS**, **iPadOS**, **tvOS**, **watchOS** and **macOS**.
