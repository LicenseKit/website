# Licenses

LicenseKit is free to use for up to 10 code- or file-based licenses. Just use the license key **"FREE"** to use a trial version with a limited set of licenses. You can then choose from three tiers:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

You can hover tiers and features for more information. [Contact us for Enterprise needs](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20Enterprise) if your company have more than 10 employess or $1M in annual proceeds.

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or [over e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) using your preferred payment method. You can add your company information and VAT number when purchasing.



## Features

Visit [GitHub]({{site.github_url}}) for a full list of features, sample code, online documentation, articles, a demo app etc.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year** and **one app/library**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using LicenseKit.

You will receive a welcome email with a license agreement when your license has been activated. The license period starts when the license is activated, not at purchase.

If we are unable to activate your license within 48 hours after purchase, we will do our best to get in touch with the reason for the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before the license has been activated.


## Technical requirements

LicenseKit targets the current iOS version and two major versions back. It may stop supporting any older OS versions, but will only do so in a major version upgrade.

LicenseKit is built with the previous major version of Xcode 3 months after a new major version has been released. After that, you must start using the latest major Xcode version to use LicenseKit.
