# Licenses

LicenseKit is free to use for up to 10 code- or file-based licenses. It then requires a license to unlock handling more licenses and more powerful features. 

There is a trial version and two paid tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

The trial version lets you try out LicenseKit in any app or library. Just use the license key **"FREE"** to unlock a trial version that you can use with a limited set of licenses.

The **Basic** tier is a good fit for smaller projects, while the **Gold** tier is perfect for products with many customers. Please [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) if you need paid support, help getting things set up etc.

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or using your preferred method of payment (Paypal, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one app/library** and **one year**. After your license expires, you have to renew it to keep using LicenseKit.

LicenseKit supports **iOS**, **iPadOS**, **tvOS**, **watchOS** and **macOS**.
