## Licenses

LicenseKit requires a commercial license. There are two tiers to choose from - Basic and Gold:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

The **Basic** tier is perfect for smaller project with few users, while the **Gold** tier is perfect for larger, commercial projects with many users.

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad}}) or with your preferred method of payment (Paypal, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one app/library** and **one year**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.

Basic licenses are valid for **one platform** (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS) while Pro licenses can be used on all platforms.
